I pride myself and think of myself as a man of faith, as
 there's a drive into deep left field by Castellanos and that'll be a home run,
 and so that'll make it a 4-0 ballgame.

Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle toward my hand?
 Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
 Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
 to feeling as to sight? or art thou but
 a dagger of the mind, a false creation,
 proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
 I see thee yet, in form as palpable
 as this which now I draw.

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
 for murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded.
 Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne,
 I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home.
